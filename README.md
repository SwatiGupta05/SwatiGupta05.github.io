####  _Restaurant Reviews APP_

## Description:

* It is last project of Front-End Nanodegree.

### Introduction:

* In this project, a webpage is converted into a mobile supported web application. The design is responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Also, service worker is added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

### How to Run:

1. Download the clone as zip file in to your local machine or unzipped it.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/https://github.com/SwatiGupta05/SwatiGupta05.github.io

```
2. Directly open it by clicking on this [here](https://swatigupta05.github.io/).

***Notes***

* In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

## Mapbox:
I have created a account on Mapbox and used the token in main.js to display the map on the screen.
